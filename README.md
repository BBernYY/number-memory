# number memory
To make it easier to remember long numbers, I created a script that converts them into strings of text


### The Table
number | consonant version | vowel version
0 | p | i
1 | m | e
2 | f | a
3 | s | oe
4 | t | oo
5 | n | o
6 | l | u
7 | k | ee
8 | w | ie
9 | ch | aa
## how to use
You can run the main.py script, and it will start a trainer. You can also convert numbers using the other fucntion.
